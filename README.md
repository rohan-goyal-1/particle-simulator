# OpenGL Particle Simulator

This project is an interactive particle simulation implemented using OpenGL. It simulates bouncing balls influenced by gravity, with interactions including collisions and user-controlled ball creation.

## Features

+ Interactive Simulation: Create bouncing balls by clicking on the screen.
+ Physics Simulation: Includes gravity, friction, and collision handling.
+ Dynamic Rendering: Uses OpenGL for real-time rendering of circles and their outlines.

## Requirements

+ GLFW (OpenGL library for window and context management)
+ GLAD (OpenGL extension loader)
+ C compiler with C99 support
